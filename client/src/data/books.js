The Cyberiad is oddly reminiscent of Gulliver's Travels, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Phantom Tollbooth and Alice in Wonderland. Charming, mind-bending and anarchic, it is perhaps Lem's greatest work. This edition includes all of Daniel Mroz's hallucinatory original illustrations.",

No longer used 360 degrees to cover cracks and imperfections in crumbling plasterwork, wallcoverings are now a means of expressing individuality. The new wallpaper is blurring the division between art and interior decoration. Graphic designers and illustrators are playing with scale and using walls as their canvases, while fashion and textile designers are transferring their fabric prints to paper. This book is a showcase of fresh and innovative wallpaper designs from 50 artists, including graphic designers such as Kam Tang and Sweden Graphics, fashion designers such as Eley Kishimoto and illustrators such as Japan's Chisato Shinya, as well as new directions from established wallpaper designers. Using colour photographs and original design material accompanied by exclusive interviews, this book will illustrate the wide spectrum of approaches to wallpaper with designs produced for the home and commercial spaces.",

No artist of the twentieth century has aroused more passion and controversy, nor exerted a greater influence on art, whose very nature Duchamp challenged and redefined as concept rather than product by questioning its traditionally privileged optical nature. At the same time, he never ceased to be engaged, openly or secretly, in provocative activities and works which transformed artmaking procedures. Written with the enthusiastic support of Duchamp's widow, this is one of the most original and important books ever written on this enigmatic artist, and challenges received ideas misunderstanding and misinformation.",

        "description": "What does Ferran Adria eat for dinner - and how did he feed the hard-working staff at his fabled elBulli, the first 'destination restaurant', nestled on the Mediterranean coast north of Barcelona? The Family Meal features a month's worth of three-course menus created for and by Ferran and his team - meals that nourished and energized them for each evening's service. It's the first - and only - book of everyday recipes by the world's most influential chef, now with a brand-new foreword by Ferran himself.",
